# If Fusion 360 instantly crashes, or the program doesn't work follow these steps:

Navigate to the Python folder inside Fusionâ€™s installation path:
C:\Users\YOURUSER\AppData\Local\Autodesk\webdeploy\production 
There should be 2 folders - Check for one with all the files in it including python.exe and then at the address bar type ```cmd``` (or navigate there using command prompt)

and then run
```
./python.exe -m pip install requests
```
